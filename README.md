## MOS 6502 ##
This is an implementation of the classic 6502 microcomputer which was 
introduced back then in 80's by MOS Technology,Inc.
The processor made it's way into some of the old classics like Apple2,
Atari game consoles, Commodore range of home computers and many more...

The project itself is partially completed and is under development. 
Looking forward to complete it soon along with a decent README:)

Project also features an implementation of MOS6522 
which is a versatile interface adapter for basic i/o
looking forward to complete it too if possible;)
