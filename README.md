##### MOS 6502 #####

This is an implementation of the classic mos6502 microcomputer which was 
introduced back in the 80's by MOS Technology,Inc.
The processor made it's way into some of the classics like the Apple2,
Atari game consoles, Commodore range of home computers and many more...

This project is partially completed and is under development.
Looking forward to complete it soon, with a decent README :)

This Project also features an implementation of mos6522 
which is a versatile interface adapter for basic I/O.
Looking forward to complete it too if possible ;)
